# About

This timer app is made to use while meditation. You can keep track of time during your meditation session. 

# How to use

Set the time interval for which you want to play a soft sound.

E.g. If you select 5 min, then the app will play a tone after every 5 min. So, in this way, while your eyes being closed, you still can track how much time is passed in your meditation session.
